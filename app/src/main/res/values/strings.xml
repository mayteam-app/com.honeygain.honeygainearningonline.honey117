    <string name="text6">If you encounter an error message stating "Unusable Network" in Honeygain, it typically means that your network does not meet the requirements or is not suitable for sharing bandwidth. Here are a few possible reasons and troubleshooting steps you can try:\n\n

1. Unstable or Slow Internet Connection: Honeygain requires a stable and reasonably fast internet connection to function properly. If your network connection is frequently dropping or too slow, it may result in the "Unusable Network" error. You can try restarting your modem/router or contacting your internet service provider to address any connection issues.\n\n

2. Network Restrictions: Some networks, such as public or corporate networks, may have restrictions that prevent Honeygain from functioning correctly. These networks may have firewall settings, security measures, or bandwidth limitations that interfere with Honeygains operation. If you\'re using such a network, you may not be able to use Honeygain unless the network administrator allows it.\n\n

3. VPN or Proxy Usage: If you\'re using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) or a proxy service, it can affect Honeygains ability to function properly. VPNs or proxies can alter your network settings and cause conflicts with Honeygains connection requirements. Try disabling the VPN or proxy service temporarily to see if it resolves the issue.\n\n

4. Insufficient Bandwidth: Honeygain requires a certain amount of available bandwidth to be able to share with the network. If your internet connection is heavily utilized by other applications or devices, it may not have enough bandwidth to allocate to Honeygain. Ensure that you\'re not running bandwidth-intensive activities or devices simultaneously with Honeygain.\n\n

5. Compatibility Issues: Make sure you\'re using the latest version of the Honeygain app that is compatible with your operating system. Outdated versions may have compatibility issues or bugs that can cause the "Unusable Network" error. Check for updates in your app store or on the Honeygain website and install any available updates.\n\n

If you have tried the above troubleshooting steps and the "Unusable Network" error persists, you may want to reach out to Honeygains support team for further assistance. They can provide specific guidance and help resolve any issues related to your network or configuration.\n\n
